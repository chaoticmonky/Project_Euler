Solutions to problems in Project Euler

This is my attempt at solving the problems posted on Project Euler. There are 600+ of them, so this will probably continue for several years. But I wish to solve the first 50 at least, and then select the ones that sound interesting. I will also try commenting my thought process while solving each problem. I don't know exactly why I am doing this. It soudns fun and challenging. I guess that is enought to get me going.

        First try. Let's see how it goes.
