Solutions to problems in Project Euler

This is my attempt at solving the problems posted on Project Euler. There are 600+ of them, so this will probably continue for several years. But I wish to solve the first 50 at least, and then select the ones that sound interesting. I will also try commenting my thought process while solving each problem. I don't know exactly why I am doing this. It soudns fun and challenging. I guess that is enought to get me going.

Problem 1. Multiples of 3 and 5.
        Start date: 3rd of April. 2018. Tuesday.
        First try. Let's see how it goes.
        Completed in under a minute. Simple use for loop and modulus.

        Solution: 233168
        End date: 3rd of April. 2018. Tuesday.


Problem 2. Fibbonacci.
		Start Date: 3rd of April. 2018. Tuesday.
		Simple enough too. I decided to create an array of Fibbonacci using a while loop and added all the even sums. I wanted to try recurssion for this. But I'll do that for the next Fibbo assignment.

		Solution: 461372
		End date: 3rd of April. 2018. Tuesday.
